/* 
Here we are going to create the schema and the model for storing the blog details u want to create. As the name suggest in model folder we have to create models and schema.

In the schema u have given timestamps:true, which mean it will provide the time automatically. when the blog is created. Now lets create the model
*/

export default blogModel

/*
Now u have created the model also, here we gave a model name of our choice, when we run the backend code on postman with the connected database, atlas will create this model with the schema u specified. Now have to write the core logic to add blog, so u will create it in the controller folder
