/*
Ok, i know u might be confused here but dont be. U might wonder why are u destructuring data from req.body.blog ? Its simple, we will be passing the request's body like this:-

{
  blog:
  {
    title:"",
    ...,
    image:""
  }
 
  u will be recieving everything from the form from the frontend. Here, including the image. So, using multer u are storing the image in a temperory folder inside ur disk storage. now the multer makes the image file available as req.file
} 

*/


/*
final Explanation:-

First, we get the blog data from req.body.blog (which the frontend sends as JSON or stringified JSON). Then we get the uploaded image using req.file, which is handled by Multer. This Multer gives out the actual image file obtained from the request. to know about multer, look at middleware

We convert the image to a buffer using fs.readFileSync() so it can be uploaded to ImageKit.

We upload the image to ImageKit inside a /blogs folder, and then generate an optimized URL using imagekit.url() with quality, format, and size settings.

Finally, we save everything (including the optimized image URL) into MongoDB using the blog model.

Now after going through the auth,multer and finally decalring the route for creating adding a new blog, we will proceed to creating various other api's for creating the rest of the api's for blogs and comments
